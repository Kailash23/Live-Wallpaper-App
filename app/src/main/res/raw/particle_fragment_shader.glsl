    /* This is a somewhat expensive way of drawing a point as a circle, but it works.
       The way this works is that for each fragment, we calculate the distance to
       the center of the point with Pythagorasâ€™s theorem.3 If that distance is greater
       than the radius of 0.5, then the current fragment is not part of the circle and
       we use the special keyword discard to tell OpenGL to forget about this fragment.*/

    /* This will draw a texture on the point using gl_PointCoord for the texture coordinates.
       The texture color will be multiplied with the point color, so the points
       will be colored the same way as before.*/
